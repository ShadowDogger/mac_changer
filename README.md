# mac_changer
python program to enable you to change your mac address.

This program works in Python 2.7 - 3.x so no need to worry about compatiblity.
As of right now it only works in Linux but you can expect it to work in Windows and Mac OS X soon.
To use this program its pretty simple, go to your terminal, navigate to the folder where the code is listed and run python3 (or python) Mac_changer.py -i (interface) -m (mac_address)
i is the interface you will be changing the mac address for and -m is what you are changing the mac address too.
